# Over the No-Man’s-Land: Memoir of a War for Honor  
The Time I fought for Pakistan, and Hopefully, it Remains the Only One.

A flash of red…. that is all that I saw when it passed with a dreadful whistling sound. The sound still ringing in the ears felt like a Stuka diving over the beaches of Dunkirk, leaving a trail of bombs. It did not even last a second, but that second seemed to have stretched beyond what physics could comprehend, slowing everything down with it, and finally bringing everything to a sudden pause as I was in the midst of ducking to save myself from the harm that was targeted towards us. When the time finally reached that abrupt halt, I was able to feel everything around me… my friends who were also ducking or leaping for a cover, the look of shock and danger they had on their faces, the smell of magnesium that was burning past us, the sudden explosion of red light, tremors in the paper of speaker cone which was still playing the last song as if nothing had happened, but strangely, very strangely, there was no sound, no noise, there was an inexplicable silence, a very bizarre calmness in the still uncoiling chaos.  

It was calm, maybe because it finally came to my realization that we were suddenly and deliberately attacked by the wretched and illicit forces of India, a bunch of goons with no other agenda but our annihilation. It finally came to my realization that while we were drowned in music and dancing, enjoying the festivities of Diwali, the enemy, as coward as they were, launched a vicious and uncalled attack on us, hiding behind iron bars and firing their armada of rockets. Yes, they were the residents of the India hostel, and we, their archenemy, the proud residents of the Pakistan hostel, and just now, what they did was the declaration of WAR!!!  

And with a boom from the rocket, everything again came to life. What followed was the sound of several more such attacks fired on us, their impact even shaking the impregnable walls of our Pakistan. But we did not let those rockets to be welcomed by loneliness to our Pakistan, that is not what good hosts do, we accompanied them with our rage and wrath. Pure and naked emotions were visible in the eyes of each one of us. We had our jaws clenched, fists tightened, face reddened, the vein passing around our neck stretched, because this is what pure and naked rage looks like.  

Everyone sprang up in a coordinated action, all the firepower was amassed, possible positions of entry guarded, rockets were lined up, because it was time for the payback.  

Yes, there had been some squabbles since the morning, but by the time it was evening, both the sides were even, we took two of their boys, they kidnapped two of ours, they bombed us, we bombed them. It was even. And to be ‘even’ is a pact between gentlemen. But we misjudged… they were no gentlemen. They gave us betrayal and we will be returning it with Hell. We will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.  

Every single one of us knew that hostilities were a genuine possibility. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our home, and our interests were in grave danger. But what would we do about it? Would we fight? Fight, and we may get burns and wounds. Hide, and we will remain unscathed… our bodies may, but not our honor. And we knew, even if we ran and hid today, many years from now, dying in our beds, we will be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may harm our bodies, but they’ll never harm... OUR HOME!!! Because that’s what it was, it was not just a temporary dwelling that we were given for a few months, it was our home! It was our Pakistan!  

And, to the future batches, we were not going to pass a Pakistan which was defeated, we were not going to pass a Pakistan whose defenses were once breached, we were not going to pass a Pakistan which once hid inside its rooms, quivering and frightened, waiting for the attacks to end. We were going to hand over a Pakistan which remained unbent, unbroken, and undefeated in the face of the enemy. A Pakistan that rose and fought back its aggressors. A Pakistan whose very chant forced the enemy to shit their very soul out of their anal opening.  

To achieve this, to protect our home and our honor, we were willing to go on to the end. We were going to fight on the rooftops, we were going to fight on the ascending stairs, we were going to fight in front of the water cooler, the one which they called Kashmir and unrightfully laid a claim on, we were going to defend our home, whatever the cost may be; but we would never surrender.  

As all the adrenaline our body ever produced pumped inside us, gentlemen, we embraced the war. Volleys of rockets were exchanged, accompanied by even more explosive abuses, not even the uniformed guards who were given the responsibility to maintain peace and security of this region dared to come near. But we stood our ground, unshaken and determined. But soon the first casualty of this brutal war appeared, they sneaked an attack on one of our dustbins… yes, a trashcan, because it requires balls to face a Pakistani in full action, but they found that trashcan to be their equal. Whatever it may be, it was a property that belonged to Pakistan, and so to barbarically destroy it was unacceptable to us.   

An emergency meeting was held, and a plan of action for revenge was decided. I and one other were given the honor to carry out the attack. We were to be covered by a volley of rocket fire and simultaneous bombing attacks from the ground floor. Our mission was to jump over to their terrace from ours and infiltrate their command post, and to plant our most powerful bomb. Throughout the operation, I was in contact with the command post. I could hear and see the rockets going haywire in the no man’s land between India and Pakistan as I jumped over it. I could see my companions harassing the first floor of India by bombing them from below. I was getting constant updates on the enemy location through my phone. The tension that the people at command post were feeling was very apparent even through my phone.  

We finally reached the gates of India’s terrace. Foolishly they have left it unlatched. We entered sneakily and planted the bomb, sending the confirmation to the command post. We returned as quickly as we can, jumping back again over the no man’s land. As soon as we entered, the door of our terrace gate was locked behind us and a loud boom sounded in the whole hostel area, on a magnitude which was not heard since the onset of this war. What started with a boom, ended with a boom. The whole second floor of India was washed away in white light, a color which is associated with peace but at that moment looked only like the god of destruction, engulfing everything that came in its way. Now the things could no more be ignored by the guards of the campus. They all came running, a dozen of them. More than them, it was India who was panicked. The blast came from behind their lines. They were already shellshocked in the aftermath of that blast, but now even the guards were accusing them of sending it off. It was impossible for them to blame it on us. They were going to take the brunt of this. All of their armament was seized, they were left in no condition to continue this war. It was our victory. We had come out victorious.  

At that moment, I realized how different it is to win as a group from winning alone. When you win in a group, no one hides their emotion, that emotion, exhilaration, every feeling out there that gives you a sense of achievement can be felt in the air. At that moment, you are not breathing in oxygen, it is the elation that everyone is emitting around you, that you take in with every breath. You can feel the body going lightweight, stress knots being undone, tension being released through sweat, uncontrollable urge to keep smiling and laughing and jumping and yelling… Because you did it… You did it alongside your brothers… You defended your honor, your home… You won a war!!!  


P.S. –   
Even after all these years, when it comes to Pakistan hostel, its residents still chant: 

आये हैं सीना तान के,  लौंडे पाकिस्तान के !
